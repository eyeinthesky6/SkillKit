# Project Governance

## Overview

This document outlines the governance and contribution model for the Trinity OS SkillKit project. It defines how decisions are made and how the community can contribute to the project's direction.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Users

Users are community members who use the project. They can contribute by:

- Reporting bugs
- Requesting features
- Providing feedback
- Participating in discussions

### Contributors

Contributors are community members who submit pull requests. They can:

- Fix bugs
- Implement features
- Improve documentation
- Help triage issues

### Maintainers

Maintainers are contributors who have been given write access to the repository. They can:

- Review and merge pull requests
- Triage issues
- Help guide the project's direction

### Core Team

The core team consists of long-term contributors who are responsible for the project's vision and major decisions. They have additional responsibilities:

- Setting the project roadmap
- Making final decisions on major changes
- Managing releases
- Handling security issues

## Decision Making Process

### Small Changes

- Small changes (bug fixes, documentation, tests) can be merged by any maintainer after a successful review from at least one other maintainer.
- No formal discussion is required for small changes.

### Medium Changes

- Medium changes (new features, refactoring) require:
  - An issue describing the proposed change
  - Discussion with the community
  - At least one approval from a core team member
  - No objections from other maintainers (with a 72-hour waiting period for feedback)

### Major Changes

Major changes (breaking changes, major new features, changes to governance) require:

1. A formal proposal in a GitHub Discussion or GitHub Issue
2. A minimum 7-day discussion period
3. Approval from at least 2/3 of core team members
4. No strong objections from the community

## Voting

When a formal vote is needed, the following process is used:

1. A voting issue is created with a clear description of the proposal
2. The voting period is 7 days
3. Votes are cast using GitHub reactions:
   - 👍 - Yes/Agree
   - 👎 - No/Disagree
   - 🤷 - Abstain
4. A proposal passes if it gets:
   - At least 2/3 of votes are in favor
   - No more than 1/3 of votes are against
   - At least 3 core team members have voted

## Becoming a Maintainer

1. Express interest to the core team
2. Have a history of quality contributions
3. Be nominated by an existing maintainer
4. Be approved by a majority of current maintainers

## Removing a Maintainer

A maintainer can be removed by:

1. A proposal from another maintainer
2. Discussion with the core team
3. A 2/3 majority vote of the core team

## Conflict Resolution

1. Try to resolve conflicts through discussion
2. If needed, involve other maintainers as mediators
3. If consensus cannot be reached, a formal vote may be called

## Changes to This Document

Changes to this document follow the same process as Major Changes, requiring:

1. A proposal with clear rationale
2. Discussion period
3. Approval from the core team

## Code of Conduct

All participants in the project are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
