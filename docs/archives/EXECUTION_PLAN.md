# SkillKit 8-Week Execution Plan

**Date:** November 5, 2025  
**Vision:** Secure Runtime + Proven Workflows + Universal Protocol = The Workflow Platform  
**Status:** Strategic direction confirmed, ready to execute

---

## 🎯 The Corrected Strategy

### What Changed

**Initial assessment (too pessimistic):**
- ❌ "Workflow system is just bash commands"
- ❌ "Cross-IDE is too hard"
- ❌ "MCP is unproven"
- ❌ "Ship minimal MVP and wait"

**Corrected assessment (strategic PM view):**
- ✅ Workflow concepts ARE universal (commands adapt)
- ✅ Cross-IDE IS achievable (VSCode forks + MCP protocol)
- ✅ MCP IS integral (THE protocol for 2025)
- ✅ Platform play with community scale

---

## 📊 The Three-Layer Platform

### Layer 1: Runtime (v1.0) ✅ COMPLETE
**Secure execution foundation**
- Sandboxed JavaScript execution
- JSON Schema validation
- Comprehensive audit trails
- CLI interface
- **Status:** Production-ready, 58 tests passing

### Layer 2: Workflows (v1.1) 🎯 NEXT 2 WEEKS
**The competitive advantage**
- 19 proven, battle-tested workflows
- Framework adapter system
- TypeScript reference implementation
- **Status:** Workflows exist, need conversion

### Layer 3: Universal Access (v1.2) 🔑 WEEKS 3-4
**MCP protocol integration**
- One implementation → 5+ IDEs
- Skills as MCP tools
- Workflows as MCP prompts
- **Status:** MCP is standard, we implement

## 🚧 Risk Management

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** MCP protocol changes  
**Mitigation:** Monitor Anthropic updates, implement to spec, community will alert us  
**Probability:** Low (protocol is standardizing)

**Risk:** VSCode fork APIs diverge  
**Mitigation:** Protocol-based (MCP isolates us), only test don't deep-integrate  
**Probability:** Medium (but MCP handles it)

**Risk:** Workflow adapters don't work for all languages  
**Mitigation:** Community builds what they need, we provide templates  
**Probability:** Low (concepts are universal)

### Adoption Risks

**Risk:** Developers don't see value  
**Mitigation:** Clear use cases, video demos, easy onboarding  
**Probability:** Medium (overcome with good marketing)

**Risk:** MCP adoption stalls  
**Mitigation:** Also support AGENTS.md, direct CLI, can pivot  
**Probability:** Low (Anthropic is pushing hard)

**Risk:** Community doesn't contribute  
**Mitigation:** We build 3 adapters as examples, lower barrier  
**Probability:** Medium (typical for new projects)

## ✅ Decision Points

### After Week 2 (Workflows Complete)
**Evaluate:**
- Are workflows converting cleanly?
- Is adapter system working?
- Do we need to adjust approach?

**Go/No-Go:** Proceed to MCP if workflows are solid

### After Week 4 (MCP Complete)
**Evaluate:**
- Does MCP work in 3+ IDEs?
- Is protocol integration stable?
- Are developers interested?

**Go/No-Go:** Proceed to community features if MCP validates

### After Week 6 (Community Platform)
**Evaluate:**
- Are people submitting workflows?
- Do adapter templates work?
- Is there demand for marketplace?

**Go/No-Go:** Proceed to launch if community shows interest

### After Week 8 (Launch)
**Evaluate:**
- npm downloads trend
- GitHub engagement
- Community feedback
- Feature requests

**Decision:** Iterate, pivot, or scale based on data

## 🎤 Why This Will Succeed

### 1. Proven Foundation (Not Experimental)
- v1.0 runtime: Production-ready ✅
- Workflows: Battle-tested in ProfitPilot ✅
- Not building from scratch, assembling proven pieces ✅

### 2. Protocol-Based (Not Custom Integration)
- MCP: Official Anthropic protocol ✅
- VSCode forks: 80%+ API compatible ✅
- One implementation, many IDEs ✅

### 3. Platform Model (Not Monolithic)
- Core runtime: Our expertise ✅
- Framework adapters: Community contribution ✅
- Language-specific workflows: Community scales ✅

### 4. Right Timing (Not Too Early/Late)
- AI coding agents: Mainstream now ✅
- MCP: Early adoption phase (first-mover advantage) ✅
- Workflow standardization: Just emerging (blue ocean) ✅

### 5. Clear Differentiation
- vs. Anthropic: Native execution + validation (not just instructions)
- vs. OpenSkills: Secure runtime + MCP (not just CLI wrapper)
- vs. CI/CD: Local + AI-assisted (not server-side deployment)
- vs. MCP servers: Development workflows (not external tools)

**We're not competing. We're creating a new category.**
